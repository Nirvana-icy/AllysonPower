##Project Name:A smart phone application to support citizen journalism  
##Background 
In the late of the last century, digitization and networking as the world's development has brought great changes.In this age, information technology revolution has been happening around us always. Telephone, mobile phone, television, computers and other electronic tools increasingly popular, more and more convenience to people's lives.Especially for the mobile phone.
According to reports,there are more than 11.46 hundred million people use mobile phone in China[1] and Smartphone users online 109 minutes on average every day[2].They use mobile phone to reading ,chatting and more and more of them like use it to share informations that they met.They like share beautiful scenery, shining star, emergencies and everything.
Most of the sharing is for leisure,such as express the mood.And there are many kinds application that people can used nowadays for example Twitter Facebook Renren Weixin and so on.They are all wonderful application.But is there is a application that can encouraging people upload public events,providing news clues to journalism, statistical and organizing events in different regions,I think this application will be very useful for mass media.
##Aims and objectives
In this project I want to develop a application that guide user upload public events.For example ,if a user witness a kindhearted and generous man help old people up when they fall over,maybe he would be encouraged and want to share this good news to public and even sent this to journalism.Then this user can use this application to share and provide this clue conveniently.Of course user can share good news or bed news both.
“We are all witness”.Maybe there are more than one user of this application had been encouraged by the event.So there will be many people share this event.Of course some of them don’t want to connect with journalism.They just share this news.Don’t worry.This application have a function that can statistic and manager the keywords of the events.Journalism can find events that they interested in by themselves use the keywords.
Overall, this application not only provides the opportunities for users to share even sale their news to journalism , also provides some clues to media agencies .
##Implementation and basic architecture

(Application sketch)
       
1.This application will be developed in java language.  
2.This application will use “energy” as the theme.After survey,I recognized that there are not very much user want to sent the events that they met to journalism directly because sometimes they need consider themselves security first.But if they use this application,firstly they can browser other events first.If he browser positive events more,they will be encouraged more,then may be he want to upload or send more.Otherwise if he browser negative things that other user uploaded more,their justice will be more.Anyway,in my opinion,I think this theme can guide user say more.  
3.This application will have four main functions.  
Briefly,the firs one:  
(a)"New energy",this part collection all the energy that user posted.User can find the latest news both positive and negative.  
The second one:(b)"Surrounding energy",I want to use map to show the energy distribution.User can find the energy that surround them.More positive energy,more encourage.  
The third one:(c)"Energy statistics".If possible,I want find the keywords of the energy that user post.Such as the hot news,This will help the journalism to find the hot energy.  
Last one:(d)"User have something to post".this part user can post the things that they met and can select sent to journalism or not by themselves.

Ps:”6th Week” means the sixth week of 2014
##Conclusion
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to try to do this application.After some discussing ，researching and writing this proposal,I have more understanding about what I should do and when I should do for this application.
This application is very useful for public news spread.I will try my best to finish the functions that I mentioned there.
